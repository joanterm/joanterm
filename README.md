<h1>🏥 into 💻</h1>

<h1>Hi there! 👋 My name is Joanna 🌸</h1>

<h3>I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, focused on Front End Development. My journey began more as a hobby that I picked up to practice problem solving. As time went on, it transitioned into a full time adventure that continues until today. I'm building up on skills I have acquired working in the medical field for over 8 years-- compassion, communication, reliability. Those are words that I believe describe me ✔️ </h3>

<h3>I am close to being a Bloomtech programming bootcamp graduate, currently building side projects in Node.js. I have built multiple solo API projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js. I am also experienced working with multiple clients building their websites in Wordpress. It gives me a huge please knowing my websites are being visited by real people every day.
