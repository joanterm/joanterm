## 🏥 into 💻

# Hi there! 👋 My name is Joanna 🌸

## I'm a Front End Web Developer. My journey began more as a hobby that I picked up to practice problem solving. As time went on, it transitioned into a full time adventure that continues until today. I'm building up on skills I have aquired working in the medical field for over 8 years-- compassion, communication, reliability. Those are words that I believe describe me ✔️ 

#### Some of the main technologies I have experience with:

🌸 HTML

🌸 CSS

🌸 JavaScript

🌸 React

🌸 Wordpress

I am experienced working with real clients building their websites in Wordpress. It gives me a huge please knowing my websites are being visited by real people every day. You can visit my portfolio at https://joannaterman.com/.

## Feel free to reach out! I'm mostly active on Twitter 😉
